## Hi there 👋 I'm Matthew Bonnichsen 

**Computer Science Student @ UTSA | Software & Game Developer**

### 😄 About Me

I’m passionate about **building interactive experiences**, **developing tools that help people**, and **contributing to the niche community of game development**.
My projects blend retro-inspired game design with modern development practices, showcasing both creativity and technical skill.

I love working in **Unity** and **Blender** to craft meaningful and fun PS1-style experiences, experimenting with low-poly art, shader effects, and post-processing.
Outside of game dev, I explore .NET MAUI, graphical programming, and reverse engineering to better understand how software and systems work from the inside out.
